amirkabir.1.d:0 "Amīr-e Kabīr planned to send some students to Russia for training so that we could catch up with the Farang-ī production methods."

amirkabir.1.f:0 "To become less dependent on European imports, the reformist grand vizier, Amir-e Kabir sent a few students to Russia to be trained, amongst other things, in the art of papermaking. Despite his execution in 1852, many of his plans survived, such as that of establishing modern industries in Iran. Āqā Raḥim Eṣfahāni, who returned from Russia in 1854, established a paper factory in the neighborhood below the Eṣfahān Gate in Tehran. Additional paper-mills (kārḵāna-ye kāḡaḏgari) were also established in both Tehran and Isfahan under Nāṣer-al-Din Shah, although it is not clear whether this was the same as the one built by Āqā Raḥim Eṣfahāni. According to Mahdiqoli Hedāyat quoting his father, the paper factory in Isfahan failed because the government used the paper that it produced without paying for it. In 1892, a concession was granted to this Belgian group for the manufacturing of glass, pottery, candles, and paper. The production of paper was exempt of all taxes and customs duties and the government would support the industry in exchange for 2.5 percent of the net profits. The duration of the paper concession was fifty years, but the initiative fell through"

#Confront British envoy
justin_sheil:0 "Arrival of the English ambassador"
justin_sheil_reason:0 "In late 1847, Sheil was recalled to London and replaced with Colonel Francis Farrant, who also negotiated for abolition with Aqasi. Farrant argued if the Ottoman Empire could abolish slavery in their nation, Iranians could do the same. The argument appealed to Aqasi, who suggested it to Mohammad Shah. Mohammad was ready to adapt the changes similar to those of the Ottomans because it is clear from the letter he sent to Farrant. Mohammad Shah agreed to the abolition of the slave trade through the Persian Gulf but having slaves and trading them over land was still allowed. On the advice of both Sheil and Farrant, Aqasi also approached the major ulama of Tehran to ask their consent should the slave traders accuse them of blasphemy. The results were unfavorable; most of the ulama regarded slavers as legal according to Mohammedan law. Sheil, however, was successful in obtaining a fatwa in support of the shah's decision."

#turan_decision 
turan_decision:0 "Fight back the Jahansuzan and regain power in Turan!"
turan_decision_desc:0 "The Treaty of Akhal was a treaty signed by Iran and Imperial Russia on 21 September 1881. The treaty marked Iran's official recognition of Khwarazm's annexation by the Russian Empire. Although Iran had won a clear victory in the last Ottoman–Iranian War (1821–23) over their Ottoman arch rivals, it had been considerably weakened by years of ineffective rulers, the defeat against Russia in 1813 and 1828 in which they lost all of the Caucasus, and with the increasing occupation by Great Britain of Egypt, during the years of 1873 to 1881, and on top of that the decaying Ottoman Empire, Imperial Russia stepped up its campaign to wrest full control over Central Asia. By virtue of this treaty, Iran would henceforth cease any claim to all parts of Gostana and Farā-rūd (Transoxiana), setting the Atrek River as the new boundary. Hence Merv, Sarakhs, Ashkanabad, and the surrounding areas were transferred to Russian control under the command of General Alexander Komarov in 1884. If you can react before 1880 you might stop Russians and even reclaim what is lost in Kafkas!"
